This is the fourth freeCodeCamp project for web development, when we are asked to build a technical documentation for something. Then I choose to build a React.js docs to this task. Note that this docs does not replace the awesome official documentation that is found [HERE](https://reactjs.org/), this is just a project with a few topics.
